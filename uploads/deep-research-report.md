# Free 12‑Week Irish Taxation Self‑Study Course Design

## Executive summary

A free, practical 12‑week self‑study course can be created to **mirror the topic coverage and sequencing** of the UCD Professional Academy Diploma in Irish Taxation, while **avoiding any copying of proprietary teaching text** by building the curriculum around **Irish primary/official sources** (notably Revenue guidance, Citizens Information explanations, and the underlying legislation). The UCD course publicly lists 12 weekly modules spanning Income Tax (including USC/PRSI), VAT, CGT, Corporation Tax, and CAT—plus administration, research, and planning topics—making it feasible to mirror the scope at a learner‑competence level, but without offering a formal credential. citeturn5view0turn5view1

Crucially, much of the official Irish tax guidance you would link to (and, where appropriate, quote sparingly) is re‑usable under Ireland’s Public Sector Information (PSI) approach: Revenue explicitly encourages re‑use and specifies a CC BY 4.0‑aligned licence/attribution requirement for content on its website (with exclusions such as names/crests/logos). entity["organization","Office of the Revenue Commissioners","ireland tax authority"] citeturn20search0turn20search4 The Citizens Information website similarly states its information may be reproduced/re‑used free of charge subject to the PSI licence terms. entity["organization","Citizens Information Board","ireland public body"] citeturn20search1

This report provides a ready‑to‑build **open course blueprint**: week‑by‑week modules, objectives, primary reading lists (Revenue.ie, CitizensInformation.ie, legislation), weekly exercises and quizzes with sample answers, worked computations (Income Tax+USC/PRSI, VAT3, CGT, CT, CAT), an assessment rubric, capstone marking scheme, time estimates, and accessibility/formatting guidance for slides, cheat‑sheets, and spreadsheets.

## Reference syllabus and comparison with the diploma

The course page publicly describes the programme as a **12‑week** diploma covering all the major tax heads, and lists module titles from “Introduction to Irish Taxation” through VAT, CGT computation/reliefs, Corporation Tax computation/losses, and CAT exemptions/planning. citeturn5view0turn5view1 The brochure specifies part‑time study as **one 3‑hour live online evening class per week over 12 weeks**, and assessment as MCQ quizzes (20%) plus a **3,000‑word written assignment (80%)**, with an electronic diploma issued on completion. citeturn5view1 The course is marketed as updated for the latest Finance Act and “2026 tax regulations” (including Budget 2026 measures). citeturn5view0turn5view1turn12search7

A free self‑study course can mirror this **topic map + sequencing**, but should be explicit that it is **not a formal qualification** and does not include live instruction, tutor feedback, or an institution‑issued credential.

**Legal/ethical boundary for “mirroring without copying.”**  
Mirroring a syllabus is generally about **topics and learning outcomes**, not reproducing teaching notes. A safe approach is: (a) write your own explanations; (b) link to official pages; (c) use your own numbers and scenarios for exercises; (d) keep quotes short; and (e) use PSI licence attribution where you re‑use public sector information. Revenue explicitly permits free re‑use (copy/modify/publish/translate/adapt/distribute) subject to PSI/CC BY attribution and other conditions (including not using Revenue logos/symbols). citeturn20search0turn20search4

**Primary law sources.**  
For legislation references, the enacted Acts are available via the Irish Statute Book (e.g., Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; VAT Consolidation Act 2010; CAT Consolidation Act 2003). citeturn4search0turn4search1turn4search2 Revenue also notes that Irish Statute Book versions may not include later Finance Act amendments, and provides Notes for Guidance updated through Finance Act 2025. citeturn4search8turn4search28

entity["organization","Law Reform Commission","ireland statutory body"] The Law Reform Commission’s “Revised Acts” service is another way to read administratively consolidated legislation (useful for navigation), but you should still treat the underlying law as the source of truth. citeturn4search13

### How to use this plan

This plan assumes **basic numeracy and no prior tax training**. The weekly pattern is deliberately repetitive to build competence:

1) Read official guidance → 2) Extract the rule into a 1‑page cheat‑sheet → 3) Apply it in a spreadsheet computation → 4) Self‑quiz → 5) Record your sources (link + date + “what changed my understanding”).

Where the course references “Revenue manuals,” it primarily means Revenue Tax and Duty Manuals and Notes for Guidance, which are designed to help explain operation of tax law (while commonly stating they are guidance and not definitive legal interpretation). citeturn4search28turn24search3

### Worked example set

The examples below are deliberately **educational**: they focus on the computation mechanics and source‑checking. They are not a substitute for professional advice for complex cases.

#### Worked computation: Income Tax + USC + PRSI for a PAYE employee (2026)

Scenario (simplified): Single PAYE employee with **gross annual pay €52,000**, no other income, claims standard personal and employee credits only.

**Step 1 — Income Tax using 2026 band and credits**  
- Standard rate band (single): **€44,000 @ 20%**, balance @ **40%**. citeturn24search0  
- Tax credits (2026): Single Person credit **€2,000**; Employee credit **€2,000**. citeturn24search0  

Computation:  
- €44,000 × 20% = €8,800  
- Remaining €8,000 × 40% = €3,200  
- Gross Income Tax = €12,000  
- Less credits €4,000 ⇒ **Income Tax payable = €8,000** citeturn24search0turn24search8  

**Step 2 — USC using 2026 USC rate table**  
Use the 2026 USC thresholds/rates table (standard rates shown on Revenue’s USC chart page). citeturn0search8  
Compute USC progressively (rounded to cents):  
- First €12,012 @ 0.5% = €60.06  
- Next €16,688 @ 2% = €333.76  
- Remaining €52,000 − €28,700 = €23,300 @ 3% = €699.00  
Total **USC = €1,092.82** citeturn0search8  

**Step 3 — PRSI (Class A illustration; rate change within 2026)**  
PRSI rates depend on class and pay period; Class A employee rate increases from **4.2% to 4.35% from 1 October 2026** (per the gov.ie PRSI table). citeturn3search4  
A simple annualised estimate for a steady salary is:  
- Jan–Sep (9/12) at 4.2% and Oct–Dec (3/12) at 4.35% ⇒ blended rate 4.2375%  
- €52,000 × 0.042375 ≈ **€2,203.50 PRSI** (approximate; payroll applies per pay period). citeturn3search4  

**Output summary (illustrative):**  
Income Tax €8,000 + USC €1,092.82 + PRSI ~€2,203.50 ⇒ total deductions ~€11,296.32, before any other credits/reliefs. Rates/bands/credits must be checked for the specific year and circumstances. citeturn24search0turn0search8turn3search4  

#### Worked computation: VAT3 (T1–T4) from a simple ledger

Scenario: A VAT‑registered business in a bi‑monthly taxable period has:  
- Sales (all standard‑rated 23% for simplicity): net €100,000  
- Purchases with deductible VAT (standard‑rated 23%): net €50,000  

**Step 1 — Compute output VAT (T1 component)**  
Output VAT = €100,000 × 23% = €23,000 (VAT rate reference). citeturn0search13  

**Step 2 — Compute input VAT (T2 component)**  
Input VAT = €50,000 × 23% = €11,500 (assumes fully deductible and linked to taxable supplies). citeturn17view0turn0search13  

**Step 3 — Map to VAT3 fields**  
Revenue’s VAT3 guidance defines:  
- T1 = VAT on sales (and certain acquisitions/imports/services depending on circumstances)  
- T2 = VAT on purchases you are entitled to reclaim  
- T3 = payable if T1 > T2 (difference)  
- T4 = repayable if T2 > T1 (difference) citeturn17view0  

So:  
- T1 = €23,000  
- T2 = €11,500  
- T3 = €11,500 payable  
- T4 = €0  

**Step 4 — Timing check (compliance habit)**  
Revenue states VAT is filed/paid by the **19th** of the following month, extended to the **23rd** for ROS filers. citeturn19search1turn19search2  

#### Worked computation: CGT on sale of shares (basic)

Scenario: Individual sells shares for €8,000, cost €5,000, no other gains/losses.

- Gain = €3,000  
- Less annual personal exemption €1,270 ⇒ taxable gain €1,730 citeturn22search27  
- CGT rate for most gains 33% ⇒ €1,730 × 33% = **€570.90 CGT** citeturn24search20turn18search27  

Payment/filling habit: disposals in 1 Jan–30 Nov paid by 15 Dec same year; disposal return filed by 31 Oct following year. citeturn18search0  

#### Worked computation: Corporation Tax on trading profits (basic bridging)

Scenario: Irish resident company with accounting profit before tax €150,000. Adjustments: depreciation €10,000 (add back), entertaining €2,000 (add back). Capital allowances on plant & machinery: asset pool €40,000; claim one year of writing‑down allowance at 12.5% = €5,000. (Competence‑level illustration.)

- Accounting profit €150,000  
- Add backs: €10,000 + €2,000 = €12,000 ⇒ subtotal €162,000  
- Less capital allowances €5,000 ⇒ taxable trading profit €157,000 citeturn24search15  
- CT rate on trading income: **12.5%** ⇒ €157,000 × 12.5% = **€19,625 CT** citeturn24search2turn24search6  

Timing habit: Revenue indicates CT return filed and tax paid around nine months after AP end (with the 23rd‑day rule for e‑filers). citeturn19search0turn19search3  

#### Worked computation: CAT on inheritance from parent to adult child (basic)

Scenario: Adult child inherits €500,000 from a parent; no prior benefits in Group A.

- Group A threshold (on/after 2 Oct 2024): €400,000 citeturn21view0  
- Taxable excess: €500,000 − €400,000 = €100,000  
- CAT rate: 33% citeturn22search25  
- CAT due: €100,000 × 33% = **€33,000**  

Filing/payment habit: Revenue describes payment timing based on valuation date falling in Jan–Aug vs Sep–Dec windows. citeturn18search21  

## Assessment design, rubrics, and capstone marking scheme

### Weekly assessment pattern

This replicates the “small quiz + major assignment” spirit of the diploma assessment model (without copying it), while adapting it to self‑study:

- Weekly quiz (10–15 minutes): 6–10 questions, self‑marked with answer key.
- Weekly practical task (60–120 minutes): one spreadsheet computation or compliance workflow exercise.
- Weekly reflection (10 minutes): “What source did I trust most and why?” + “What assumption did I make?”

Publicly states quizzes are used throughout the course and a final written assignment is the major component. citeturn5view1

### Rubric for weekly practical tasks (self‑mark / peer‑mark)

Each weekly task is marked out of **20**:

- **Technical accuracy (8):** computations correct; correct rate/threshold used for the relevant year; arithmetic traceable.  
- **Source discipline (5):** links to the exact official page/manual section used; notes what the source says; identifies date/version.  
- **Working clarity (4):** spreadsheet is readable; assumptions clearly stated; outputs labelled.  
- **Reflection and corrections (3):** identifies at least one error or uncertainty and how it was resolved.

### Capstone project options (choose one, or do both)

**Capstone A — Personal tax portfolio (recommended for most learners)**  
Deliverables (target 10–15 pages plus spreadsheets):  
1) A full Income Tax computation for one individual with at least three income sources (e.g., employment + rental + dividends), including USC and PRSI estimate, using 2026 rates and credits. citeturn24search0turn0search8turn3search4turn12search3turn16search1

3) A one‑page tax research log showing at least 12 primary sources (Revenue pages/manuals/Notes for Guidance + one legislation link per major topic). citeturn4search28turn4search0turn4search1turn4search2  

**Capstone B — Micro‑business compliance pack (VAT + CT + owner extraction concept)**  
Deliverables:  
1) A VAT workbook (sales/purchases) that produces VAT3 T1–T4 and a narrative explaining T1/T2 mapping. citeturn17view0turn19search1  
2) A CT computation bridge (accounting profit to taxable profit), with capital allowance schedule and filing/payment dates keyed off year‑end. citeturn24search15turn19search0  
3) A short memo (800–1,200 words) describing compliance risks: late filing restrictions for reliefs, and how you would avoid them in practice. citeturn13search4turn19search9
